## Build Instructions

1. Run bootstrap.sh
1. Install Docker
1. Install Hyperscan
1. Install go for your platform (version 1.14)
1. Install go modules, if needed: `gohs`, `yaml.v3` and `color`
1. `go get github.com/khulnasoft-lab/SecretScanner` will download and build SecretScanner automatically in `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` directory. Or, clone this repository and run `go build -v -i` to build the executable in the current directory.
1. Edit config.yaml file as needed and run the secret scanner with the appropriate config file directory.

Refer to the [Install file](https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/SecretScanner/blob/master/Install.Ubuntu) for instructions on how to build on an ubuntu system.
